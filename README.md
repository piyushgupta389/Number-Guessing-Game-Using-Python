- Hint system (Too high, Too low, Very close)
- Tracks number of attempts
- Shows guess history
- Win counter for session
- Option to quit anytime
- Replay option after game ends

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Random module
- Loops & Conditional statements
- Functions

## 📌 How Game Works
1. Choose difficulty level
2. System generates a random secret number
3. Player guesses the number
4. Game provides hints after each guess
5. Player wins if correct within attempts
6. Score tracked per session
